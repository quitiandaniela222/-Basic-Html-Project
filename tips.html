            <h3>In all marketing plans it is important to set the objectives that will guide your strategy and social
                media marketing is no exception.
                Ideally, you should use SMART goals, which in other words means that your goals should be specific,
                measurable, achievable, relevant, and temporary. </h3>

        <h2> 2.Create quality content </h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>The first step to creating quality content is to identify what type of information will be useful to
                your audience. Remember that your content must be entertaining
                <br> and visually pleasing, as users will look at all these details to evaluate it.
                <br> Also, do not forget that users do not like to be saturated with the same information, much less if
                it is only information from your company. Give them something that
                <br> interests them and above all that is useful.
                <br> On the other hand, you should take into account that, just as creating quality content takes time
                and effort, the ideal thing is to share it in the most possible channels
                <br> so that it reaches as many potential customers as possible.

        <h2> 3.Use hashtags</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3> It is important that you use hashtags so that more people can find you, but you must be aware
                <br> of which are the social networks in which hashtags are useful and which are not.
                <br> For example, on Facebook they are not useful because nobody searches for hashtags on this social
                network,
                <br> while on Instagram you have the option to search by hashtag and all the relevant content regarding
                that word or phrase appears.

            <h3> You must identify who you want to address on social networks as they are an essential part of your
                strategy.
                <br> Remember that you must build your buyer persona not only through assumptions but also through
                research.
